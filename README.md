Greetings! I'm just this guy. I've been working in the Datacenter/Systems Administration/DevOps/IaaS world for a really long time. 

I'm currently running [nomadops, llc](https://github.com/nomadops) a small IaaS consulting company focusing on Terraform implementation and maintenance and implementation.
